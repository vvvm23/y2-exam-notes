\subsection{Networks Overview}

A computer network is a group of devices that are connected to one another in order to exchange information or share resources. 

A network protocol defines the format and order of messages transferred between network entities and the actions taken on transmission and receipt of messages.

Networks can use a variety of mediums to communicate over- both wired and wireless.

Networks, at their core, are meshes of interconnected routers and devices. Packet switching is the process of breaking application layer messages into packets and forwarding each packet from one device to the next across links on the path from source to the destination.
