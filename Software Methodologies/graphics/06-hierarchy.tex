\subsection{Scene Graph}

A Scene Graph is a collection of nodes in a graph or tree structure. A tree node may have many children but often only a single parent. The effects of a parent are applied to all its child nodes. This means an operation performed on a group is automatically propagated to all members.

For example, a table could be group containing its legs, the top and another group which represents a bowl of fruit. When we move the table group the bowl of fruit will move with it.

This can be implemented in WebGL either as an actual tree structure or by simply popping and pushing the model matrix to some stack.
